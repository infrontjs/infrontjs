A simple, smart and pure vanilla javascript framework.

**For developers who...**

* ... like simple and smart solutions
* ... want to have full control of your code and no black boxes 
* ... prefer to stay close to the platform and want to use its full power
* ... know vanilla javascript, css3 and html5
* ... avoids abstraction should be at its minimum
* ... do not want to learn additional domain specific languages and concepts (e.g. for templates etc)
* ... prefer a painless and easy-to-configure toolchain

* ... are tired of wasting time on permanent framework version updates 
* ... don't want to take the risk that their product is built upon a framework which might become outdated in the near future
