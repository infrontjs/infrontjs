# InfrontJS - API documentation

Welcome to the official api documentation of InfrontJS.

This api documents all the methods you need to know about to work with the framework. We try to keep everything as simple as possible.

Since we are working very hard on keeping InfrontJS as minimal as possible, we also like to encourage you to browse through the codebase on github. We try our best to provide you a clean and transparent codebase.
